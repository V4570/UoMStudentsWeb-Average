# UoMStudentsWeb-Average

Script that uses Selenium to login to the StudentsWeb Service, extract grades and print them and the true average.
Made it cuz i was bored of logging in every time and wanted to try selenium.

# Install requirments
pip install requirments.txt

# WebDriver
You need to add geckodriver.exe(Windows) or gecko(Linux) to your path for selenium to work.

# For Linux

> chmod +x geckodriver

> export PATH=$PATH:/path-to-extracted-file/geckodriver
